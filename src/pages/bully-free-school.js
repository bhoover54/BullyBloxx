      <h3>Bully Free School</h3>
      <p className="">
        What does Bully-Free schools mean? To most parents and citizens it means no student is allowed to abuse anyone in their school. If an incident does occur, the abuser is immediately shut down before it happens again. This is the bully-free standard that most communities set and the standard
        that BullyBloxx provides when properly utilized.

        Neighborhoods and communities want bully free schools for 4 main reasons:
        <ol>
          <li> To provide a much safer environment for children in their schools.</li>
          <li>To create an environment where children can thrive, socially and academically, without being afraid of anyone.</li>
          <li>To reap the financial rewards of living in a neighborhood with bully-free schools and the significant increase in property values gained from that. Bully-Free neighborhoods should also see a reduction in crime, especially domestic crime.</li>
          <li>Any responsible parent in todayâ€™s world would immediately seize an opportunity to have their children in a Bully-Free school</li>
        </ol>
