      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>My name is Mack Galphin and I led in the development of BullyBloxx. Parents and communities all over America are demanding bully-free schools for three main reasons:</p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>To provide a much safer environment for their children in their school.</li>
          <li> To create a new environment in the school that is happier, brighter and much more conducive to learning allowing students to be educated at a much higher and far more effective level.</li>
          <li>To reap the financial rewards and the significant increase in property values from living in a neighborhood with bully-free schools.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        The citizens in these communities demand a system that quickly shuts down the abuse, school shootings and suicides because of bullying and keeps them shut down.........We developed BullyBloxx to fill this need for communities who were making their schools bully-free. .....By allowing the
        epidemic levels of bullying in our schools today we are teaching our children to abuse even those who they spend their lives with...........those who are closest to them. That bleeds over into every part of their lives..........bullying is a 100% learned behavior..........all these bullies
        in schools were taught by someone, they weren’t born bullies...........the good thing is a learned behavior like bullying can also be unlearned...........and that is one of the things that bullybloxx does......... it unlearns bullying behavior with one simple rule.........here is how........
        A man named James Wilson was my first black teacher and a great influence on me, first as a student and later as a board member at his school......... What I learned from him was invaluable in developing this BullyBloxx system. I met him when our schools integrated in 1970 in Ninety Six,
        S.C. Ninety Six was a small, uneducated, openly racist, cotton mill town. Student ratio was about 60% white. When the schools were forced to integrate I was with the first group of white students to attend Edgewood School which was previously the black school and now the Middle School for
        about 300 students; I was in the 7 th grade. Coach Wilson was the boys P.E. teacher and every boy in the school had class with him every day. He was a former Marine boxing champ and about 35 years old. He was a superior athlete and nobody in the school could compete with him. He was the
        school’s disciplinarian for all the boys..........you got in trouble you went to him.......On day #1 he gave every boy in that school a rule to follow........it was real simple...........”keep your hands and your mouth to yourself”...........with that one rule he intended to integrate a
        middle school in a small, openly racist south carolina mill town and do it peacefully...........and he did just that.........the truth is, we had a ball.........both black and white..........there was always lots of fun and laughing out loud........we became friends......... This same rule
        will work today......let’s stop addressing the victims and let’s address the bullies for a change.........bullying is not the victim’s problem to solve.........in fact, victims have no way of solving the bullying problem.........the only one who can solve the bullying problem is the bully
        and we at BullyBloxx believe that it is time for all communities to tell all of their bullies in all of their schools exactly what Coach James Wilson told all of us boys on day #1 of integrating the schools...... way back in sept of 1970......in Ninety Six, S.C...............He said ”you are
        going to keep your hands and your mouth to yourself”........and when the community tells the bullies this, mean it......just like Coach Wilson did................. BullyBloxx gives the community the ability and the option to enforce Coach Wilson’s rule on every bully..............personally,
        i think it’s the answer..........and I have seen it work...that is why I developed BullyBloxx....”keep your hands and your mouth to yourself”.........it’s really simple.........except today, 52 years later, we say..........”keep your hands and your words to yourself”....... Every community
        makes it’s own decision on bully-free schools. Communities that desire bully-free schools have BullyBloxx to help achieve that. BullyBloxx provides the school administrators with a system that gets bullying reported and the support of the community to shut it down after it’s reported.
